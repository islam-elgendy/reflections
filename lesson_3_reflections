When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  I can use a remote repository as a back-up to my files to save these files on the cloud rather than on local device. 
  Also, I can use a remote repository to share my work with others who can contribute to my project. 
  Furthermore, I can the remote repository to resume my work from elsewhere, as I'm not tied up with my own local device.
