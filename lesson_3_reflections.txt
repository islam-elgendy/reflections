When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  I can use a remote repository as a back-up to my files to save these files on the cloud rather than on local device. 
  Also, I can use a remote repository to share my work with others who can contribute to my project. 
  Furthermore, I can the remote repository to resume my work from elsewhere, as I'm not tied up with my own local device.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Automatic pull might put some unnecessary overload on the network, no need to pull changes that are not complete yet. I might want 
  to have someelse contribute to the project, and when he finishes, I'd like to pull the changes not before.
